## Introduction

Building a website for your resume can be an excellent way to showcase your skills and professional experience. In the spirit of sharing and collaboration, I have decided to publish the source code of my website. By doing so, I hope to offer others the opportunity to utilize it as a template or reference for their own resume websites.
  
## Structure 

### The website is structured using HTML tags to define the document structure. Here are some key elements:

    HTML tags such as <html>, <head>, and <body> are used to define the overall structure of the document.
    The CSS stylesheet style.css is linked to the HTML using the <link> tag, allowing for customized styling.
    Inside the <head>, there is a <script> tag containing JavaScript code. It waits for the window to load and then scrolls to the top of the page for a smoother user experience.

## Sections

### The website is divided into different sections using the <section> tag. Each section serves a specific purpose. Here are some notable sections:

    Hero Section: <section class="hero"> contains the main content of the website. It showcases the website owner's introduction and description.
    Project, Skills, Experience, Education, and Contact Sections: These sections provide detailed information about the owner's projects, skills, professional experience, education, and contact details. Each section is wrapped in a <div class="box-wrapper"> and <div class="box"> for consistent styling.

## Additional Features

    Typewriter Effect: The heading <h1> inside the hero section has a class "Moving-text typewrite" and includes custom data attributes (data-period, data-type) for a typewriter effect animation.
    External JavaScript: The website includes an external JavaScript code from https://tryhackme.com/badge/1666577. This code can load a badge or some external content dynamically.

## Usage

Feel free to utilize the published source code as a template or reference for your own resume website. Customize the content, add your projects, skills,  experience to make it your own
